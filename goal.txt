# Next goal
develop a test cases/micro benchmark for tools
similar to taint analysis paper 

Points to benchmark for js, test precision, soundness
different categories i.e context sensitivity, aliasing, ICC

JS features + static analysis features

droidbench benchmark (for taint)
each category had multiple apks

start simple, with aliasing, query the points to size 
start with test cases 

3 to 10 for each 
generate config.json for each feature i.e aliasing

share the list of features first


----------------------------------

callsite by default on safe: 20
add 10%: 22
deduct 10%: 18
add 20
deduct 20
add 50% 
deduct 500%
add 100%
deduct 100%
add 500%
deduct 500%

interested in combinations?
10 for each
10 * 10 * 10
thousand configs we will try

- move to aria
- expand test cases
- study the results
