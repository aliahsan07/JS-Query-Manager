# Next goal
develop a test cases/micro benchmark for tools
similar to taint analysis paper 

Points to benchmark for js, test precision, soundness
different categories i.e context sensitivity, aliasing, ICC

JS features + static analysis features

droidbench benchmark (for taint)
each category had multiple apks

start simple, with aliasing, query the points to size 
start with test cases 

3 to 10 for each 
generate config.json for each feature i.e aliasing

share the list of features first
